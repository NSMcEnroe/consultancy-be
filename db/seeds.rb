# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# Find an existing RecipeModel or create a new one if none exists

# Below was used to test direct backend upload to S3 - PASS 
# recipe = RecipeModel.find_by(title: 'Sample Recipe')
# recipe.image.attach(io: File.open("app/assets/images/web_light_rd_ctn@1x.png"), filename: "web_light_rd_ctn@1x.png")
